Unlike content management systems like WordPress or Squarespace, Jekyll provides you with all of your site’s code/text in an easy-to-access format using markdown files and plain HTML. Websites made with Jekyll can easily and freely be hosted with GitHub. 

Ultimately, this all means that you can edit and write the markdown files in a plain text format from your phone using the GitHub mobile app. Whereas using a CMS from your phone may not always be possible or easy. If you'd like to quickly give Jekyll a try, you can fork the GitHub repo titled [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), rename it to your GitHub username + “.io”, and then you'll have a site up and running just like that. In fact, I wrote this whole post using my phone.
