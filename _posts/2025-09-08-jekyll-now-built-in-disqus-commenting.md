I wrote an [article]( Writing Blog Posts From Your Phone With Github and Jekyll – Seth Louis ... ) about how I often write and even publish posts using my phone and Jekyll. Jekyll Now, the specific theme I use, even includes built in support for setting up commenting using Disqus, the most popular blog commenting add on. 
I began trying to add commenting using Disqus to my blog and was running into issues, I realized after about an hour of troubleshooting that Barry Clark already has Disqus integrated into the theme! 

All that’s needed is to setup an account using the Disqus website, and then to input your unique short name into the Disqus global variable in your Jekyll config file. Then just like that, you have comments! Great stuff, truly. Thank you, Barry Clark! If you haven’t already, but are interested in setting up your own blog or site using Jekyll, go star Barry Clark’s, Jekyll Now repository on GitHub, or even better clone it and rename it to your GitHub username + ‘.io’ to have your own blog immediately up and running.
