The human body is home to hundreds of species of micro-organisms. The important part they play in keeping us healthy by inhabiting our gut has already been established. Recently scientists are learning these microorganisms play an important role in keeping us healthy by living on our skin as well. These microorganisms can prevent pathogenic (aka bad bacteria/germs) from infecting us, alert our bodies when we are infected, and promote healing of wounds. Using body soap/body washes harm this natural protective layer covering our skins. Using soap on our hands is of course a necessary, life saving practice. Using soap on our bodies on the other hand not only doesn’t serve a purpose but actually harms us. 

While there isn’t evidence to show that the same is true of our hair and shampoo, anecdotally people have claimed their hair’s natural oils balance out. With time many people claim their hair feels better after giving up hair washing products. This all leads me to believe that using body wash, body soap, shampoo, and conditioner are simply redundant products that aren’t improving my life. 

By saying no to these unnecessary products, I’m able to be healthier, save money, contribute to less waste, and in a small way take an anti-capitalist action. If you’re concerned about smelling bad, there are alternative ways to stay smelling fresh and good. My current shower/hygiene routine includes showering regularly, scrubbing myself with a loofah and just water, massaging my scalp and hair, using mainstream deodorant (this may change eventually), and using cologne. My partner would tell me if I smell bad, and has told me before. Since beginning this about a week ago though, she has told me I smell fine and normal.
