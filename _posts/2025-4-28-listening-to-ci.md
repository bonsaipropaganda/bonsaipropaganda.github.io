It's actually been over 160, but 150 sounded nicer.

My journey with CI (comprehensible input) began when I was a teenager in the 2010s when I stumbled on a video of Stephen Krashen explaining the [input hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis).

His thoughts and video on language acquisition are something anybody interested in languages would benefit from.   

After failing to learn Japanese for years as a preteen, the ideas Krashen put forth immediately clicked. His examples within the video using pure CI to teach a language, really drove the point home. If this short talk and demonstration isn't enough to convince you that CI works, you could also see the folks who used it, what their results are, and how effortless the process was.

Arguably the best way to make up your mind about comprehensible input, is to experience it for yourself. There is quite a time committment and buy in though before you actually see results due to the sheer number of hours it takes to learn a language. This is where the series "O Pilin E Toki Pona" is a godsend. This series teaches you a tiny language called [Toki Pona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona) using only CI. The process feels like magic, and the experience lets you overcome the biggest hurdle when using only CI, and that's the belief that it actually works. Watching your brain effortlessly acquire a language really solidifies that this actually works.  

A side note on Toki Pona: this is a constructed language, in other words entirely made up language. The language has extremely few words in it (under 200!) and a very simple gramar. This is what allows the series ["O Pilin E Toki Pona"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwYL9_SRAk8EXSZPSTm9lm2kD_Z1RzUgm) to be so effective because in a short amount of time you are able to experience the growth that would take much longer with a normal, natural language. 

Comprehensible input is intuitive. Afterall, we all say "they picked up" the language. CI just gives you the necessary input to "pick it up". For years, I was convinced of this, but struggled with not knowing how to actually do this or how long it would take. I needed a roadmap. There was also barely any discourse on it that I could find. An organization called [Dreaming Spanish](https://www.dreamingspanish.com/about) created a roadmap based on their actual experience of using only CI to acquire and help others acquire languages. It was the last piece I needed.
