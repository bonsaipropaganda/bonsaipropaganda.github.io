Cast iron skillets aren't overhyped. Everyone thinks they are, but they're wrong. Cast iron skillets are the right amount of hyped.

Cast iron skillets are beautiful, and here's why: they're timeless. When you hold a cast iron skillet it feels like a solid real thing. It feels like it doesn't belong in an apartment. It feels like it belongs in a cabin in the woods. A nonstick skillet will last a few years, and cause cancer during that short lifespan. A cast iron skillet feels fancy and will literally last a lifetime. People even pass cast iron skillets on between generations. 

So now that cast iron skillets have been established as superior, a great way to make the most of a cast iron skillet is with lazy cooking! Being lazy is great. It's smart even. It helps conserve energy, come up with ideas, and proces things when learning. A great way to maximize a cast iron skillet and be lazy is to use it when pan frying anything! Most of the time the goal when pan frying anything from chicken, veggies, or those store bought frozen dumplings is to get a little color and crunch on those food items. Ideally those things are nice and crunchy on the bottom and top, so people stir it around occassionally. 

The trick here is with a cast iron skillet, it can go in the oven as well. Place whatever needs to be fried in the cast iron skillet, and set a timer for as many minutes as needed. Once, the timer goes off put that cast iron skillet in the oven and turn the broiller on. Once again, set a timer! After that timer goes off, boom! The food is cooked and crispy on the top and bottom, and the best part is it took almost no work. No standing around and stirring was necessary while waiting for the food to cook and crunch up. This and the timelessness of a cast iron skillet make it the best.
